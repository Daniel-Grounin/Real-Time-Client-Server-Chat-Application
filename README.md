## Vulkan ImGui Example - Extensions

This repository contains the basic Vulkan ImGui example, which is now extended with additional real-time chat functionality. The updates include:

- **Chat System Integration:** The `client.cpp`, `server.cpp`, `chat.cpp`, and `chat.h` files add a fully functional chat system to the Vulkan ImGui application, enabling communication between multiple users.
- **Server and Client Setup:** The `client.h` and `server.h` provide the necessary definitions for server-client interactions in this chat system.

These extensions build on top of the Vulkan ImGui framework, maintaining its performance while adding new features.

For more details on using this extension, please refer to the code in the respective files.
