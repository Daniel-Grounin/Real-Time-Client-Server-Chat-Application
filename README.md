## Vulkan ImGui Example - Chat System Extensions

This repository extends the basic Vulkan ImGui example with a real-time chat system. The following updates have been made:

- **Chat System Integration:**  
  The files `client.cpp`, `server.cpp`, `chat.cpp`, and `chat.h` implement a fully functional chat system, enabling communication between multiple users in the Vulkan ImGui application.

- **Server-Client Communication:**  
  The `client.h` and `server.h` files define the structure and methods for the server-client interactions, ensuring seamless communication in the chat system.

These extensions build on the Vulkan ImGui framework, preserving its performance while adding new features such as real-time chat functionality.

For more information on using the extension, please refer to the code in the respective files.
